### Project Overview
The Titanic was a British Passage Liner that sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage, leading to significant loss of lives. This project analyses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. THe dataset contains various features about the passengers such as their ID, sex, ticket class, survival, embarked and more.
### Applications Employed 
The following applications were used in the Titanic Survival analysis:
1. Excel for data cleaning.
2. SSMS for writing and analyzing queries to help in the assessment of the provided dataset.
3. Power BI for comprehensive visualization effects.

### Data Examination 
The following questions were raised in course of analysis:
1. Total passengers by class
2. Survival rate by passenger class
3. Survival rate by sex
4. Number of passengers who embarked from each port
5. Passengers with large families (more than 3 siblings/spouses or parents/children)
6. Average fare paid by each passenger class
7. Distribution of ages among survivors and non survivors
8. Passengers with missing embarkation data

### Visualization 
The use of Power BI to transform raw data into interactive visualizations, enabling users to uncover insights.

### Findings
1. The total passengers onboard the Titanic ship is 1309 consisting of both children and adults.
2. The total Passengers by class are in this order:
- Upper class = 323,
- Middle class = 277,
- Lower class = 709.
3. The number of Survivals by passenger class are in the order;
- Upper class = 136,
- Middle class = 87,
- Lower class = 119.
4. The number of passengers who embarked from each port are;
- South Hampton = 270,
- Cherbourg = 123,
- Queenstown = 914,
- Null = 2
5. The average fare paid by each passenger class are;
- Upper class = 87,
- Middle class = 21,
- Lower class = 13.
6. Passengers with missing embarkation data are 2. The passenger ID of 62 and 830
